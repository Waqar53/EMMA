> ⚡ **This project is under active development.** What you see below is what's been built and tested so far.
> The vision is much bigger — I'm shipping new features weekly to make EMMA the most capable
> autonomous medical AI agent ever built. Watch this repo to follow the journey.

<br/>

> **EMMA doesn't just answer phones — she thinks, reasons, acts, learns, and protects patients.**
>
> An autonomous ReAct agent loop with real-time clinical triage, emergency detection,
> appointment booking, prescription management, SMS/WhatsApp communication,
> and a self-evaluation engine that scores every interaction.

##  Why This Exists

GP surgeries in the UK handle **300+ calls daily**. Patients wait **23 minutes on average** just to speak to a human. Critical emergencies get lost in queues. Receptionists burn out.

**EMMA replaces this entire workflow** with an AI that:
- 🧠 **Thinks autonomously** using a ReAct (Reason + Act) agent loop
- 🏥 **Clinically triages** patients using NICE guidelines and SNOMED-CT codes
- 🚨 **Detects life-threatening emergencies** in real-time and triggers 999 protocols
- 📱 **Sends real SMS** via Twilio for confirmations, recalls, and alerts
- 📊 **Self-evaluates** every interaction and scores its own performance
- 🔁 **Proactively reaches out** to patients for check-ins and recall campaigns

### The 5-Step Decision Framework

Every patient interaction follows this clinical reasoning chain:

1. **🛡️ SAFETY** — Scan for red flags (chest pain, stroke symptoms, suicidal ideation)
2. **🧩 CONTEXT** — Look up patient records, history, medications, allergies
3. **🎯 INTENT** — Classify what the patient needs (appointment, prescription, test results, admin)
4. **⚡ EXECUTE** — Call the right tools autonomously (book, prescribe, triage, alert)
5. **🧠 MEMORY** — Log everything, persist to database, record for audit

---

## 🛠️ The 18 Tools

EMMA has **18 autonomous tools** she can chain together without human intervention:

| # | Tool | What It Does |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | `lookup_patient` | NHS number + DOB verification against patient database |
| 2 | `check_available_slots` | Real-time appointment availability with clinician matching |
| 3 | `book_appointment` | Slot reservation with SMS confirmation |
| 4 | `cancel_appointment` | Cancellation with reason logging |
| 5 | `triage_symptoms` | NICE-guideline clinical triage with SNOMED-CT coding |
| 6 | `check_test_results` | Lab result lookup with 3-tier delivery protocol |
| 7 | `submit_prescription` | Repeat prescription request with pharmacy routing |
| 8 | `answer_admin_query` | Opening hours, registration, practice info |
| 9 | `log_patient_memory` | Persistent memory across conversations |
| 10 | `recall_patient_memory` | Context retrieval from previous interactions |
| 11 | `nhs_pds_lookup` | NHS Personal Demographics Service integration |
| 12 | `check_nhs_status` | Real-time NHS Spine/API health monitoring |
| 13 | `check_practice_capacity` | Staff availability and capacity analysis |
| 14 | `get_medication_info` | BNF drug information and interaction checks |
| 15 | `send_sms` | Real Twilio SMS delivery to patients |
| 16 | `send_whatsapp` | WhatsApp messaging via Twilio |
| 17 | `alert_emergency_contact` | 🚨 Emergency protocol — SMS to next of kin + GP flag |
| 18 | `self_evaluate` | AI self-scoring (clinical safety, empathy, efficiency) |

---

## 🚨 Emergency Protocol — The Killer Feature

When EMMA detects cardiac symptoms, stroke indicators, or suicidal ideation:

```
Patient: "I have severe chest pain radiating to my jaw and I feel dizzy"

EMMA's Brain:
  Step 1: alert_emergency_contact → 🚨 PROTOCOL EXECUTED (8.8s)
  Step 2: triage_symptoms → Urgency: EMERGENCY, Red flags: 🔴 Cardiac

EMMA: "Robert, I'm so concerned about your symptoms. Please call 999
       immediately. I've triggered our emergency protocol to ensure
       your safety. Please don't wait. Is there someone with you?"

Self-Evaluation: 8/10 (Excellent)
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. ✅ SMS sent to emergency contact (next of kin)
2. ✅ Urgent GP flag created in health alerts
3. ✅ Patient receives safety SMS with 999 guidance
4. ✅ Immutable audit log entry created
5. ✅ Agent escalated to "Escalation" mode
